The inference process generates a posterior distribution - which has a central role in Bayesian statistics - together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivate the inference process.\n",

    "When working with Bayesian models there are a series of related tasks that need to be\n",
    "addressed besides inference itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diagnoses of the quality of the inference\n",
    "* Model criticism, including evaluations of both model assumptions and model predictions\n",
    "* Comparison of models, including model selection or model averaging\n",
    "* Preparation of the results for a particular audience\n",

    "Successfully performing such tasks is central to the iterative and interactive modeling\n",
    "process. These tasks require both numerical and visual summaries to help statisticians\n",

    "> Exploratory data analysis (EDA) seeks to reveal structure, or simple descriptions in data. We look at numbers or graphs and try to find patterns. We pursue leads suggested by background information, imagination, patterns perceived, and experience with other data\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models** takes many of the ideas commonly associated with EDA and applies them to the analysis of Bayesian models and their results.\n",

    "In the following sections we will discuss how to use [ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/index.html) to perform Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models, together with a discussion of good practices for Bayesian modeling. As visualization plays a central role in exploratory analysis of Bayesian models we begin our discussion with some general topics around visualization."
